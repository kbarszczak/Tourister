The taller of them, decorated with a rich baroque cupola, is the Clock Tower. The lower one, covered with a pyramid-shaped roof, is called the Silver Bells Tower or the Victorian Tower.

The roof of the tower was designed by Dominik Puck and was not built until the 18th century. Previously, the tower was covered with a helmet very similar to the top of the taller tower of St. Mary\\'s Church. We can see it on a woodcut from 1581, included in the work \"Constitucie Statuta y Privilege at the General Crown Seyms from 1550 until 1581, passed\", published by the printing house of Mikołaj Szarffenberg in Krakow. The Silver Bell Tower was then the highest of the Wawel towers, and a helmet similar to St. Mary\\'s also adorned the tower of the Town Hall. This is clearly the fashion that was in force in Krakow at that time ...\\nOn the ground floor of the tower there is a Gothic chapel of the Szafraniec family, rebuilt in 1420 and covered with a rib vault. The late-baroque altar of the chapel, from 1769-72, is the work of Franciszek Placidi, and the polychrome walls and stained glass windows, created in 1906-8, are by Jozef Mehoffer. In 1937, the crypt under the tower was rebuilt to house the sarcophagus with the ashes of Marshal Józef Piłsudski.\\nThe upper storeys of the tower act as a belfry. The wooden structure supports three bells: \"Nowak\" - from the 13th century, supposedly made of an even older bell, \"Gaworek\" - from 1496 and \"Maciek\", made in 1669 by Michał Weinhold from Gdańsk.

It was on the top floor, with five bedrooms and two bathrooms (although one requires you to walk through the master bedroom). One of the bedrooms had a hot tub in addition to the shower, the other had only a shower. The water heater is rather small, and ran out of water when we showered (we were nine adults staying here).

Fact is, you HAVE to open them if you're here in the summer, as it can be around 35°C (95°F) outside in the summer, and the apartment gets warm. The problem then is that it quickly becomes really dirty with black dust, the toddler we had with us ran barefoot inside and her feet were a dark gray from the dirt.

After accepting my application, I was supposed to receive an email about accepting me to the group, which I did not receive. I made a phone call in which I found out that the group was already large and they could not accept more people. So someone from the institute was clearly at fault and did not take care of their duties, as a result of which I am losing a trimester of study through no fault of my own, and this institute is the only one that offers study in trimesters, so when enrolling in another school there is a problem of which level to choose.', 'I recommend it 100%.
